Hello! Welcome to my repository! This is where I will be sharing my code for the projects and other assignments! 

The PREMIER PROJECT in this repository is the TO-DO APPLICATION: (to-do.py finished)

HOW TO USE IT: 

Once this program starts to run it will welcome the user to the application and display a list of 4 options from the main menu. 
The choices (1-4) allow the user to to manage the task list by adding, removing, or viewing tasks in the list or quit the application. 

Thank you, enjoy!
